# Brunnr Demo Script - Lesson to Video Pipeline
**Duration: ~3 minutes | Target: Show lesson-to-video generation**

## üé¨ Opening (30 seconds)

**[Screen: brunnr.com homepage]**

"Hi, I'm demonstrating Brunnr - our AI-powered educational video generation platform. Today I'll show you how we transform static lesson content into engaging educational videos in under 2 minutes."

**[Navigate to login, then dashboard]**

"Let me sign into our production system..."

## üìö Lesson Selection (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Dashboard ‚Üí Generate ‚Üí From Lesson]**

"Here's our dashboard. I'll create a new video from educational content using our lesson-to-video pipeline."

**[Click "From Lesson" ‚Üí Shows lesson selection]**

"We have a library of validated educational lessons. I'm selecting this 4th-grade math lesson on 'Adding and Subtracting Fractions Using Number Line Models' - perfect for demonstrating our capability."

**[Select lesson ‚Üí Shows lesson preview]**

## üîÑ Generation Process (1.5 minutes - talk while it generates)

**[Click "Generate Video from Lesson"]**

"Now I'll start the video generation. This typically takes 1-2 minutes, so let me explain what's happening behind the scenes..."

**[While generation runs, explain the technology]**

"Our AI system is:
- **First**: Analyzing the lesson's HTML content and mathematical expressions
- **Next**: Converting the static content into a dynamic video manifest with timing and animations
- **Then**: Rendering the mathematical notation, number lines, and visual elements using our custom engine
- **Finally**: Generating synchronized voiceover and compositing everything into a cohesive educational video

What makes this powerful is that we're not just screen-recording static content - we're intelligently parsing educational materials and creating purpose-built animations that enhance learning.

The system handles complex mathematical notation, interactive elements, and maintains educational best practices for pacing and visual hierarchy."

## üé• Result & Conclusion (30 seconds)

**[Video completes, shows embedded result]**

"Perfect! In under 2 minutes, we've transformed a static lesson into an engaging video that students can watch before diving into the full lesson content.

Notice how the video is embedded right within the lesson - it's not replacing the content, but enhancing it. Students get a quick 'mastery in a minute' overview, then can work through the detailed lesson below.

This demonstrates our core value proposition: taking existing educational content and making it more engaging and accessible through AI-powered video generation."

## üéØ Key Demo Points to Emphasize:

1. **Speed**: "Under 2 minutes from lesson to video"
2. **Intelligence**: "AI-powered analysis, not just screen recording"  
3. **Integration**: "Video enhances lesson, doesn't replace it"
4. **Educational Focus**: "Purpose-built for learning with proper pacing"
5. **Production Ready**: "Live system handling real educational content"

## üìù Backup Talking Points:

If generation is faster than expected:
- Show the lesson content quality
- Highlight the mathematical notation rendering
- Mention the 790 lessons ready for processing

If generation is slower:
- Explain the complexity of mathematical rendering
- Discuss the educational design principles
- Talk about scalability and partner integration
