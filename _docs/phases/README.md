# Development Phases

This directory contains detailed implementation phases for building the Brunnr frontend. Each phase is designed to be self-contained and can be implemented by an LLM agent with minimal context.

## Phase Structure

Each phase document includes:
1. **Pre-implementation instructions** - What to review before starting
2. **Clarifying questions** - Questions to ask the user before beginning
3. **Detailed task checklist** - Step-by-step implementation tasks
4. **Verification checklist** - How to know the phase is complete
5. **Common issues & solutions** - Troubleshooting guide

## Implementation Order

### ðŸ“‹ [Phase 1: Setup & Foundation](./01-setup-phase.md)
**Goal**: Initialize Next.js project with authentication and core infrastructure  
**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Key Tasks**: Project setup, Tailwind config, Supabase auth, base components

### ðŸš€ [Phase 2: MVP Core Features](./02-mvp-core-features.md) 
**Goal**: Implement video generation workflows and basic functionality  
**Duration**: 4-5 hours  
**Key Tasks**: Quick generation, step-by-step pipeline, video player, project management

### âœ¨ [Phase 3: Enhanced Features](./03-enhanced-features.md)
**Goal**: Add advanced features like manifest editing and analytics  
**Duration**: 3-4 hours  
**Key Tasks**: Manifest editor, analytics dashboard, transcript tools, template library

### ðŸŽ¯ [Phase 4: Polish & Deploy](./04-polish-and-deploy.md)
**Goal**: Final polish, testing, and production deployment  
**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Key Tasks**: UI polish, performance optimization, testing, Vercel deployment

## How to Use These Documents

1. **Start a new conversation** with your LLM agent
2. **Attach the phase document** you want to implement
3. **Include relevant _docs files** mentioned in the phase
4. **Say "Implement this phase"** and answer any clarifying questions
5. **Review the work** as the agent progresses

## Important Notes

- Each phase assumes the previous phases are complete
- Always review the pre-implementation instructions
- Let the agent ask clarifying questions before starting
- Test thoroughly before moving to the next phase

## Total Timeline

**Estimated Total Time**: 11-15 hours for complete implementation

This can be done in one focused day or spread across multiple sessions.
