# Brunnr Frontend Deployment Issue Context

## Current Problem
The Vercel deployment is returning 404 errors on all routes, including the root path (`/`). The application builds successfully but seems to not be serving any pages.

## Expected Behavior
- `/` should redirect to `/auth/login` if user is not authenticated
- `/` should redirect to `/dashboard` if user is authenticated
- All other routes should work normally (auth pages, dashboard, project pages)

## What We've Already Tried

### 1. Password Protection (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: Initially getting 401 Unauthorized with `_vercel_sso_nonce` cookie
- **Solution**: User disabled password protection in Vercel project settings
- **Result**: Now getting 404 instead of 401

### 2. Middleware Updates (IMPLEMENTED)
- **File**: `src/middleware.ts`
- **Changes Made**:
  ```typescript
  // Added root path redirect logic
  if (request.nextUrl.pathname === "/") {
    const url = request.nextUrl.clone();
    if (user) {
      url.pathname = "/dashboard";
    } else {
      url.pathname = "/auth/login";
    }
    return NextResponse.redirect(url);
  }
  
  // Updated protected routes to include /project
  const protectedPaths = ["/dashboard", "/project"];
  ```
- **Status**: Code changes committed and pushed, but deployment still returns 404

### 3. Deployment URLs Tested
- Production URL: `https://brunnr-frontend.vercel.app/` → 404
- Latest deployment: `https://brunnr-frontend-c51883wke-cale-mcnultys-projects.vercel.app/` → 404
- User's specific URL: `https://brunnr-frontend-9270ztmvw-cale-mcnultys-projects.vercel.app/` → 404 (this is an older deployment from 23 minutes before the fix)

### 4. Verification Commands Run
```bash
# All returned 404
curl -I https://brunnr-frontend.vercel.app/
curl -I https://brunnr-frontend-c51883wke-cale-mcnultys-projects.vercel.app/
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://brunnr-frontend-9270ztmvw-cale-mcnultys-projects.vercel.app/
```

## Key Project Details

### Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript (strict mode, ES5 target)
- Supabase for auth and database
- Vercel for deployment

### Important Files to Check
1. `next.config.js` - Check for any output configuration
2. `package.json` - Verify build script
3. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout
4. `src/middleware.ts` - Already updated with redirect logic
5. `.vercel/` directory - Check for any deployment configuration

### Environment Variables Set in Vercel
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `BRUNNR_API_KEY`

## Recommended Debugging Steps for Next Instance

1. **Check Build Output**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Look for any warnings about missing pages or export issues
   ```

2. **Verify App Structure**:
   - Ensure `src/app/page.tsx` exists (it does, but currently shows a landing page)
   - Check if all page.tsx files have proper default exports
   - Verify no conflicting route configurations

3. **Check Vercel Build Logs**:
   ```bash
   vercel inspect [deployment-url]
   # Look for build errors or warnings
   ```

4. **Test Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run build && npm start
   # See if the same 404 issue occurs locally
   ```

5. **Consider Framework Preset**:
   - Verify Vercel is detecting this as a Next.js project
   - Check if `vercel.json` is needed for any special configuration

6. **Possible Root Causes to Investigate**:
   - Missing or incorrect `output` configuration in next.config.js
   - Issue with App Router detection in Vercel
   - Middleware might be intercepting all routes incorrectly
   - Build output not being generated in expected location

## Context for Solution
The application works locally in development (`npm run dev`), but fails when deployed to Vercel. This suggests a build or deployment configuration issue rather than a code issue. Focus on:
1. How Next.js is building the application
2. How Vercel is serving the built files
3. Any discrepancies between local and production environments

## Current Git Status
- Branch: `feature/mvp-core-features`
- All changes committed and pushed
- Latest commit includes middleware fix for root path redirect

Please start by running the recommended debugging steps and checking the build output carefully for any anomalies.
