# Project Overview

This project is a speed build to create a polished, production-ready frontend for the Brunnr Service API, enabling users to explore and utilize the API's educational video generation capabilities through an intuitive web interface.

---

## Core Purpose

Build a modern web application that serves as an interactive playground for the Brunnr Service API, eliminating the friction of using Postman or curl commands while showcasing the full power of the video generation pipeline.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Features

Deliver a functional application with essential capabilities:

- **Secure user authentication via Supabase**
- **Step-by-step video generation wizard matching API pipeline**
- **Real-time progress tracking and error handling**
- **Video preview and download functionality**
- **Clean, modern UI that looks professional**

---

## Phase 2: Enhanced Control & Iteration

Add features that leverage the API's flexibility:

- **Edit and retry individual pipeline steps**
- **Manifest visualization and editing**
- **Generation history and re-download**
- **Analytics dashboard for timing insights**
- **Responsive design for mobile access**

---

## Ultimate Goal

Deploy a production-ready tool TODAY that internal teams can immediately use to explore the Brunnr API's capabilities, with a foundation solid enough to later serve educators and students without modification.

## Key Constraints

- **API-First**: No custom functionality beyond what the API provides
- **Speed**: Complete deployment within one day
- **Polish**: Modern, professional appearance despite rapid development
- **Simplicity**: Minimize complexity by leveraging existing services (Supabase, Vercel)
